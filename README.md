# 10 Monkey Classification 🐒🔍

Welcome to the "10 Monkey Classification" project! 🌟

Classify 10 diverse monkey species using PyTorch 🐍 and ResNet-18 🖼️. Dive into the fascinating world of deep learning and computer vision to automatically identify and categorize these adorable creatures.


## Features ✨
- Dataset: Curated collection of high-res monkey images for accurate classification 📷.
- Model: Employing PyTorch's ResNet-18 architecture for precise predictions 🔍.
- PyTorch Power: Leverage PyTorch's simplicity and flexibility for seamless implementation 💪.
- Preprocessing: Apply data augmentation and normalization for robust performance 📈.
- Train & Evaluate: Train the model, monitor progress, and evaluate its prowess 💻.
- Inference: Witness the model in action – input an image, get the species! 🐵

## Steps Involved 🔨
1. Calculating mean and standard deviation: Compute the mean and standard deviation of the dataset for normalization.
2. Data loading and transforms: Load the data and apply data augmentation and normalization transforms.
3. Training neural network: Train the ResNet-18 model on the dataset using PyTorch.
4. Saving the file: Save the trained model for future use.
5. Running it: Use the saved model for inference on new images.
